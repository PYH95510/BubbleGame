# Explanation
1. This project is a great for deep understanding the DI (Dependency Injection). Also, I have used Lombok for creating getter and setter method. <br>
2. For understanding detailed steps, I have created test packages and the final version packages seperately. <br>
3. It is also great to understand how to use mContext. <br>
4. To add enemies, you can add them to the List<Enemy>
